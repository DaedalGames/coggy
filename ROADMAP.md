**This document owns sequence: milestones, their gates, and what must be true to advance.** [README](README.md#documentation) maps the rest.

## What This Is

COGGY does not build games. It decides **how many game-building harnesses can run at once.**

So the unit here is not a feature but a gate. Every milestone ends in a number. No number, no advancing. And when a number contradicts the plan, we change the plan rather than the number — [PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) gets rewritten, not the gate.

There are no dates. Duration estimates exist, and an estimate is not a promise.

## Current Priority: M0 · Attribution

**This is the only work in flight.** No other crate exists.

We build `sessionbench` and nothing else. It establishes the as-is **redline** and names what limits it. The metric, the six axes, the comparison set, and the rules that keep the benchmark honest live in [sessionbench/README.md](sessionbench/README.md).

**Before the ramp, run one session to completion.** A single real generation session, logged for RSS over time, Defender scan events at startup versus during file writes, and output volume. One afternoon, one machine, no ramp harness. Multiply by 100 on paper and compare against the redline conditions: if the shape contradicts them, fix the conditions before building the instrument that applies them. Arithmetic already retired spawn time as a ceiling; this is the same move applied to what replaced it.

**Gate G0:** an as-is redline, frozen, with its limiting cause named.

- **Pass:** a redline pair such as `84 / RSS` for every target in the comparison set, each reproducible from its recorded hardware.
- **Fail:** any run producing a bare number, or one aggregate figure plus a guess at the cause.

**No pass/fail threshold attaches to the redline value itself.** The four conditions define what counts as *sustained*, not a bar COGGY must clear. Whatever as-is produces is the right answer: M0 locates the ceiling rather than beating it, and M1 carries the first target COGGY has to hit.

**Attribution rule:** [Decision 1](docs/PLAN.md#four-core-decisions) claims that dropping conhost is worth half the project. If RSS turns out not to be the limiting condition, or if it is but conhost is not a material share of it, that claim is false and the decision gets rewritten before M1 begins. This binds.

### Reading before M0

Digest these before writing code.

1. **cmuratori/refterm** FAQ and demo videos — the measurement methodology for why Windows Terminal is slow
2. **Microsoft Docs: ConPTY / CreatePseudoConsole** — the canonical account of what can and cannot be bypassed
3. **Windows working set and commit accounting** — what RSS actually counts when 200 processes sit resident for hours

## Sequencing Direction

Three rules set the order.

1. **Measurement precedes structure.** No architecture box becomes a crate before M0 closes.
2. **Headless precedes screen.** The harness drives batches through the CLI. A UI is only needed for human audit, so it lands at M4.
3. **Off-the-shelf precedes hand-built.** Every milestone names what it consumes before what it writes.

**Dependency rule:** each milestone starts only on the **output** of the one before it. No starting the next in parallel while a gate is open. M2 is the sole exception, for the reason given in its section.

## M1 · Headless Daemon

2–3 weeks. Requires G0.

Build the `coggyd` daemon and the `coggy` CLI: pipe-first spawning, ring-buffer scrollback, session status events, socket API.

**What it consumes:**

- **wezterm/portable-pty** — ConPTY wrapping is already done. We do not write it.
- **alacritty_terminal** or **termwiz** — VT parser and grid model. Both are designed to be used as libraries.
- **Zellij** — Rust session daemon plus thin client. The prototype for the `coggyd` / `coggy-ui` boundary.
- **Ghostty / libghostty** — boundary design for extracting a core as a library. That cmux wrapped it into a product is evidence the design is right.
- **cmux socket API** — naming conventions across 40+ subcommands. [PLAN's fixed contracts](docs/PLAN.md#fixed-contracts) bind us to this vocabulary.

**Gate M1:** 100 sessions held for an hour at total RSS under 4GB, per-session work rate within 2× of solo, and no dropped output. Cold start under 30 seconds is a nice-to-have recorded in the startup log, not a gate — [it is 0.02% of the workload](docs/PLAN.md#residency-not-spawning).

**Measurement rule:** take these three numbers with **the same harness** used at M0. Build a second bench and the M0 baseline becomes incomparable.

## M2 · Harness Contract

2 weeks, running **in parallel** with the new harness build. This is the one exception to sequential ordering, because both sides have to design the contract together.

The new harness drives game-generation batches through the `coggy` CLI and socket API. No UI. The API surface is derived backward from the calls the harness actually makes. Session reattachment after daemon restart lands here too.

**Gate M2:** **100 games/day** completed unattended. Not 1000 — see [the credit ceiling](docs/PLAN.md#honest-constraint-unlocking-sessions-leaves-credits-locked).

**Remeasurement obligation:** at the same gate, measure per-game tokens and wall-clock against the new harness and update [Why this exists](docs/PLAN.md#why-this-exists) with the result. The old harness's figures are retired at this point.

**This is when it gets announced.** The repo is already public — see [the license section](docs/PLAN.md#license-gpl-30-or-later) — but nothing is posted anywhere until G-M2 passes, because announcing something that does not run earns issues rather than stars.

## M3 · Resource Governor

2 weeks.

Job Object quotas, core budget scheduler, build queueing, automated Defender exclusions.

**What it consumes:**

- **Windows Job Objects** — `CreateJobObject` plus `JOBOBJECT_CPU_RATE_CONTROL_INFORMATION` for per-session CPU and memory ceilings
- **Defender exclusion automation** — a five-minute implementation with the largest felt impact on game projects. M0 will already have measured how large this term actually is

**Gate M3:** the machine survives 100 concurrent session builds without swapping, and per-session work rate stays within 2× of solo while they run.

## M4 · Audit Surface

3 weeks. **The first screen appears here.**

`coggy-ui`: render 1–4 focused sessions and draw the other 96 as status lines. Alert ring, magnetic docking window with HWND tracking.

**What it consumes:**

- **orca** (stablyai, YC-backed) — session status UI, alerts, account switching, usage tracking. 27k+ stars since its March 2026 launch. Both a UX reference and a speed benchmark
- **Zed GPUI** or **wgpu** directly — native 60fps rendering
- **typometer / Chad Austin, "Terminal Latency on Windows"** — how to measure keystroke-to-screen latency, which only becomes meaningful once a human is watching a focused session

**Gate M4:** a human reads the state of a 100-session batch from the UI alone within 5 minutes.

## M5 · Engine Adapters (Exploratory)

Duration undecided. The gate gets rewritten after M4's measurements.

Attach the four official MCP servers from [the semantic layer reference](docs/PLAN.md#semantic-layer-reference-surveyed-2026-07) — Unreal 5.8, Unity 6, Blender, Godot AI — plus a PIE capture pane.

**Nothing is built new.** All four engines have official or quasi-official MCP, and COGGY only consumes. Godot is where we have the most room to contribute.

## Non-Goals

Ordered by the milestone at which each temptation first appears.

- **We will not skip M0.** Optimize without measuring and you will rewrite it all in Rust and lag exactly as much.
- **We will not hand-write a VT parser.** Crates exist. Burn three weeks here and the project is over.
- **We will not assume git worktrees.** Game projects carry hundreds of GB of binary assets. Every existing multiplexer breaks here.
- **We will not build UI before M2.** A screen looks like progress, but the bottleneck is in the daemon.
- **We will not put generation, verification, or repair verdicts in the daemon.** The moment they land, COGGY stops being infrastructure and becomes harness v2 — and dies with the harness at its next rewrite.
- **We will not reinvent engine control.** We consume only.
- **We will not build pricing or a landing page now.** Run it internally for six months before deciding whether to spin it out.

## Decision Principle

One question decides whether to start any piece of work.

**Does this move the number on the gate that is currently open?**

If it does not, it belongs to a later milestone, and it does not happen now.
